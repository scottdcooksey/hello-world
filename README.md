# hello-world
First time 'test' repo to get acclimated to Git and GitHub.

I am a UX / UI designer learning more and more about the development process and tools to better understand the complete product development and release lifecycle. 

I believe that UX / UI along with QA / Release Managers are appropriate 'book-ends' for this lifecycle whereby the development and product marketing processes are the books/knowledge being held up by said 'book-ends'.
